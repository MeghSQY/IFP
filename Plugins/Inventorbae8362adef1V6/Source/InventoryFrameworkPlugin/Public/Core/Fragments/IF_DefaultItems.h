/**When the item is created and has its default containers

 * This fragment is much safer than the ItemsContainers
 * fragment, because that fragment allows you to
 * freely assign all the variables. Which in the long
 * term, is unsafe. For example, you want to remove a
 * container from an item, which you would do in an item
 * asset. But if you used that fragment to override
 * what the asset provides, that item won't reflect that
 * change. This fragment won't have that issue as it
 * waits until the default containers are imported, then
 * populates the items array, which is what most people
 * want to modify anyway when they are overriding
